Transformers are the bread and butter of an indexing pipeline. They can transform the chunk, extract, modify and add metadata, adding vectors, and probably a whole lot more that we haven't thought of.

There's two ways to apply a transformer. Per node or in batch.

## The `Transformer` trait

The `Transformer` trait is very straightforward:

```rust
pub trait Transformer: Send + Sync {
    async fn transform_node(&self, node: Node) -> Result<Node>;

    fn concurrency(&self) -> Option<usize> {
        None
    }
}
```

Or in human language: "You get a node, do your thing, then return a result with the node". That's it.

## The `BatchableTransformer` trait

Batchable transformers take a list of nodes, and then yield it back as an `IndexingStream`.

The trait is defined as follows:

```rust
pub trait BatchableTransformer: Send + Sync {
    async fn batch_transform(&self, nodes: Vec<Node>) -> IndexingStream;

    fn concurrency(&self) -> Option<usize> {
        None
    }
}
```

:::tip
`IndexingStream` provides several `Into` and a helper for converting different types into itself.

## Closures

`Transformer` and `BatchableTransformer` are also implemented for closures! That means you can also do the following:

```rust
pipeline.then(|mut node| {
  node.chunk = node.chunk.to_uppercase().to_string();

  Ok(node)
})

// Or in batch

pipeline.then_in_batch(|mut nodes| {
    IndexingStream::iter(nodes
      .into_iter()
      .map(|mut node| {
        node.chunk = node.chunk.to_uppercase().to_string();

        Ok(Node)
      })
    )
})
```

As a simple example, let's build an agent that can print hello world to a file use using a tool.

For brevity, this expects you have a working rust project with all dependencies configured.

import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Steps>

1. First, lets add a tool that prints hello world. With the macro, the implementation is straightforward:

   ```rust
   #[tool(
     description = "Prints hello <name>  to a file",
     param(
       name = "name",
       description = "The name to say hello to"

     )
   )]
   pub async fn print_hello(context: &dyn AgentContext, name: &str) -> Result<ToolOutput, ToolError> {
     // The context provides an `exec_cmd` method to execute a Command
     context.exec_cmd(&Command::write_file("hello.txt", format!("hello {{name}}"))).await?;

     Ok("Printing hello ")
   }
   ```

2. Let's also add a tool that can read the last printed hello file. Just for the example, we will use the struct
  variant of the macro instead.

   ```rust
   #[derive(Tool, Clone)]
   #[tool(
      description = "Reads the last printed hello <name>",
   )]
   pub struct LastPrinted {
     filename: PathBuf
   }

   impl LastPrinted {
     pub new(filename: impl Into<PathBuf>) -> Self {
       LastPrinted { filename: filename.into() }
     }

     pub async fn last_printed(&self, context: &dyn AgentContext) -> Result<ToolOutput, ToolError> {
       let file_content = context.exec_cmd(&Command::read_file(&self.filename)).await?;

       Ok(file_content.into())
     }
   }
   ```

   Note that the format for the `#[tool]` attributes is exactly the same for both macros.

3. Let's set up the context. We don't have to if we just want to use the default, but for the example it illustrates how everything fits together nicely.

   ```rust
   let executor = LocalExecutor::default();
   let context = DefaultContext::from_executor(executor);
   ```
   If you're executing code, sandboxing is a *good idea*. We also have a [docker executor](https://github.com/bosun-ai/swiftide-docker-executor).

4. Finally, we can set up the agent with our context and tools:

   ```rust
   let available_tools = vec![print_hello(), LastPrinted::new("hello.txt").boxed()];
   let agent = Agent::builder()
     .context(context)
     .tools(available_tools)
     .build()?;
   ```
5. And now we can give it a whirl:

   ```rust
   // The agent loop on its messages and tool results, until there are no more completions, or when it decides to stop itself.
   agent.query("Print the name Swiftide to a file").await?;

   // `hello.txt` should contain `Swiftide`

   // When querying again, the agent retains it's messages (the context is responsible for this)
   // So let's `echo "bananas" > hello.txt` and ask it to fix it
   agent.query("Please check if the name last printed is still correct, fix it if needed").await?;
   ```

</Steps>
That concludes a very brief introduction to Swiftide agents. A lot more is possible, and this is just a trivial example.

Tools for agents are a trait, conveniently called `Tool`. The definition of the trait is as follows:

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait Tool: Send + Sync + DynClone {
    async fn invoke(
        &self,
        agent_context: &dyn AgentContext,
        raw_args: Option<&str>,
    ) -> Result<ToolOutput, ToolError>;

    fn name(&self) -> &'static str;

    // Tool Specs are converted to i.e. JsonSpec for OpenAI
    fn tool_spec(&self) -> ToolSpec;

    // Generally we want to give a list of tools to an agent, boxing them is the solution
    fn boxed<'a>(self) -> Box<dyn Tool + 'a>
    where
        Self: Sized + 'a,
    {
        Box::new(self)
    }
}
```

Macros are provided to make the implementation trivial. There is a macro for regular async functions, and one for structs if you need to have some sort
of internal state, tool, or anything else as well.

The macros will generate a ToolSpec, typed arguments (with serde_json), and the `invoke` call to the underlying function. Tools can have zero or more arguments. Their value always has to be of type `&str`.

The param names and the argument names of the function **must** be the same. Tools are executed in _parallel_.

## Creating a tool from a function

```rust
#[tool(
  description = "Search code with ripgrep",
  param(
    name = "query"
    description = "The code query to search"
  )
)]
pub async fn search_code(context: &dyn AgentContext, query: &str) -> Result<ToolOutput, ToolError> {
  let cmd = format!("rg '{query}'")

  // Extra verbose to illustrate how it works, froms and intos are also provided. However, with many dev tools a non zero exit might be intentionally handled by the llm
  match context.exec_cmd(&Command::shell(cmd)).await {
    Ok(output) => Ok(ToolOutput::Text(output)),
    Err(CommandError::NonZeroExit(output)) => Ok(ToolOutput::Text(output)),
    Err(error) => return Err(error.into())
  }
}
```

## Creating a tool from a struct

Creating a tool from a struct is similar. Important is that the struct name is the camelcase version of the method the tool should invoke.

```rust
#[derive(Tool, Clone)]
#[tool(
  description = "Search code with ripgrep",
  param(
    name = "query"
    description = "The code query to search"
  )
)]
pub struct SearchCode {
  search_cmd: String
}

impl SearchCode {
  pub async fn search_code(&self, context: &dyn AgentContext, query: &str) -> Result<ToolOutput, ToolError> {
    let cmd = format!("{} '{query}'", &self.search_cmd)

    // Extra verbose to illustrate how it works, froms and intos are also provided. However, with many dev tools a non zero exit might be intentionally handled by the llm
    match context.exec_cmd(&Command::shell(cmd)).await {
      Ok(output) => Ok(ToolOutput::Text(output)),
      Err(CommandError::NonZeroExit(output)) => Ok(ToolOutput::Text(output)),
      Err(error) => return Err(error.into())
    }
  }
}
```

## Tool output and errors

In addition to feeding back output from tools to the llm with `ToolOutput::Text`, you can also return `ToolOutput::Stop` to stop the agent. The agent can always be resumed later.

ToolErrors are typed. By default, every ToolError will hard stop the agent. If you need custom handling for an error, you can use the `after_tool` or `before_tool` lifecycle hooks to report on or modify the tool calls and results.

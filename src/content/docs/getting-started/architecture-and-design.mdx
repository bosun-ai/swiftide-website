## Design principles

- **Modular**: The pipeline is built from small, composable parts.
- **Extensible**: It is easy to add new parts to the pipeline by extending straightforward traits.
- **Performance**: Performance and ease-of-use are the main goals of the library. Performance always has priority.
- **Tracable**: `tracing` is used throughout the pipeline.

### When designing integrations, transformers, chunkers

- **Simple**: The API should be simple and easy to use.
- **Sane defaults, fully configurable**: The library should have sane defaults that are easy to override.
- **Builder pattern**: The builder pattern is used to create new instances of the pipeline.

## The-things-we-talk-about

- **IngestionPipeline**: The main struct that holds the pipeline. It is a stream of IngestionNodes.
- **IngestionNode**: The main struct that holds the data. It has a path, chunk and metadata.
- **IngestionStream**: The internal stream of IngestionNodes in the pipeline.
- **Loader**: The starting point of the stream, creates and emits IngestionNodes.
- **Transformers**: Some behaviour that modifies the IngestionNodes.
- **BatchTransformers**: Transformers that transform multiple nodes.
- **Chunkers**: Transformers that split a node into multiple nodes.
- **Storages**: Persist the IngestionNodes.
- **NodeCache**: Filters cached nodes.
- **Integrations**: External libraries that can be used with the pipeline.

### Pipeline structure and traits

- from_loader (impl Loader) starting point of the stream, creates and emits IngestionNodes
- filter_cached (impl NodeCache) filters cached nodes
- then (impl Transformer) transforms the node and puts it on the stream
- then_in_batch (impl BatchTransformer) transforms multiple nodes and puts them on the stream
- then_chunk (impl ChunkerTransformer) transforms a single node and emits multiple nodes
- then_store_with (impl Storage) stores the nodes in a storage backend, this can be chained

Additionally, several generic transformers are implemented. They take implementers of `SimplePrompt` and `EmbeddingModel` to do their things.

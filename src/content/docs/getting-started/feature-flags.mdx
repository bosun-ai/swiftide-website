In swiftide feature flags are organized per integration. Many are large libraries that would introduce significant compile time and binary size. We strongly advice to cherry-pick features that you need.

- **qdrant** - Provides a Qdrant as storage
- **redis** - Provides Redis as a node cache and as storage
- **tree-sitter** - Provides a tree-sitter based chunker for code
- **openai** - Provides prompting and embedding via openai (with `async-openai`) and/or azure openai.
- **fastembed** - Provides embedding via Qdrant's Fastembed
- **scraping** - Provides a scraping loader (with `spider`) and a html to markdown transformer (with `htmd`)

Our philosophy is to provide sane defaults and empower engineers to customize. Integrations are generally thin wrappers with a default, builder and the option to customize whatever the integration provides.

<Steps>

1. Setup the Rust toolchain ([rustup](https://rustup.rs/) is recommended)

2. Add tokio to your dependencies

   ```shell
   cargo add tokio --features full
   ```

3. Set up tokio as the async runtime

   ```rust
    #[tokio::main]
    async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
      ...
    }
   ```

4. Take a look at our [feature flags](/getting-started/features/) and enable the integrations you would like to have enabled.

5. Add swiftide

   ```shell
   cargo add swiftide --features <features>
   ```

6. Write a pipeline!

import { Icon } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

## Main features

- Fast streaming indexing pipeline with async, parallel processing
- Experimental query pipeline
- Integrations with OpenAI, Groq, Redis, Qdrant, FastEmbed, and Treesitter
- A variety of loaders, transformers, embedders, and other common, generic tools
- Bring your own transformers by extending straightforward traits
- Jinja-like templating for prompts
- Splitting and merging pipelines
- Store into multiple backends

### Other cool things

- `tracing` support for logging and tracing, see /examples and the tracing crate for more information
- Indexing Pipeline supports closures as well
- Embed either all fields on a node, combine it into a single field or do both
- Store results in memory for debugging and experimentation

:::tip
For all our integrations and tools we aim to provide sane defaults to get you started, and always allow full customizability when more is required. Check out [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/crate/swiftide/latest/) to see what is possible.

Transformers are the bread and butter of an ingestion pipeline. They can transform the chunk, extract, modify and add metadata, adding vectors, and probably a whole lot more that we haven't thought of.

There's two ways to apply a transformer. Per node or in batch.

## The `Transformer` trait

The `Transformer` trait is very straightforward:

```rust
pub trait Transformer: Send + Sync {
    async fn transform_node(&self, node: IngestionNode) -> Result<IngestionNode>;

    fn concurrency(&self) -> Option<usize> {
        None
    }
}
```

Or in human language: "You get a node, do your thing, then return a result with the node". That's it.

In batches, the `BatchableTransformer` trait is similar, except that it needs to return a stream. See docs.rs for more details.

When doing similarity search, a query might not contain semantics fully aligned with the stored documents.

Queries can be further transformed so that they do. For instance, generating subquestions is a common practice.

Additionally, both similarity search and hybrid search require embeddings to be generated on the query as well.

## The `TransformQuery` trait

The `TransformQuery` trait is defined as follows:

```rust
pub trait TransformQuery: Send + Sync {
    async fn transform_query(
        &self,
        query: Query<states::Pending>,
    ) -> Result<Query<states::Pending>>;
}
```

The transformer takes the current query, applies a transformation, and returns it.

Closures are also supported in this step.

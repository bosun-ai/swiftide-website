Currently there are two methods of search.

## Similarity Single Embedding

This is the default strategy.

Similarity single embedding does a vector similarity search. The strategy expects the query to have an embedding set.

## Hybrid Search

Search with different kinds of search in the same database, automatically rerank if supported, and return the top matching documents.

For Qdrant, the strategy expects both a dense and a sparse vector to be present. Sparse vectors can be generated with `integrations::fastembed::FastEmbed`.

Additional configuration is also possible on the strategy itself.

## Creating a pipeline with a strategy

To create a query pipeline from a search strategy, you can use the `query::Pipeline::from_search_strategy` constructor, like this:

```rust
let query_pipeline = query::Pipeline::from_search_strategy(
    HybridSearch::default()
        .with_top_n(20)
        .with_top_k(20)
        .to_owned(),
)
```

When documents have been retrieved, the pipeline needs to know how to generate an answer for the initial query.

## The `Answer` trait

The `Answer` trait is defined as follows:

```rust
pub trait Answer: Send + Sync {
    async fn answer(&self, query: Query<states::Retrieved>) -> Result<Query<states::Answered>>;
}
```

The trait is also implemented for closures.

## The `Simple` answer

In a lot of cases, the `Simple` answer might just be sufficient. It takes either a transformed context if present, or the current retrieved documents, then prompts
the LLM with the original query to generate an answer.

Optionally, it can also take a `Template` to render documents before adding them to the context.

The prompt used is straightforward:

```markdown
Answer the following question based on the context provided:
{{ question }}

## Constraints

- Do not include any information that is not in the provided context.
- If the question cannot be answered by the provided context, state that it cannot be answered.
- Answer the question completely and format it as markdown.

## Context

{{ context }}
```

## Built in answer generators

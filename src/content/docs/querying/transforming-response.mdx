After retrieving documents, you might want to transform the documents or generate better context.

## The `TransformResponse` trait

The `TransformResponse` trait is defined as follows:

```rust
pub trait TransformResponse: Send + Sync {
    async fn transform_response(&self, query: Query<Retrieved>)
        -> Result<Query<states::Retrieved>>;

}
```

The transformer takes the current query, applies transformations, and returns the new query.

Closures are also supported in this step.
